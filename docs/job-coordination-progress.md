# Job coordination implementation record

> Historical implementation log. Statements about unfinished work, publication, branch names and original-plugin paths describe the milestone where they appear; later entries can supersede them. For the audited current status, use [the status audit](status-audit.md) and [current roadmap](standalone-development.md).

Branch: `fix/job-coordination`, based on `fix/send-cancellation`.

## RAM runtime storage

Runtime send completion cursors now use `/tmp/zfs-autosnapshot-ops/status`;
bounded failure captures use `/var/log/zfs-autosnapshot-failed-sends`. Deletion
shutdown flushes only its RAM state. The worker neither reads nor writes a
boot-persisted deletion queue. Legacy Snapshot Manager storage and migrator
display state now use `/tmp`. Status polling no longer initializes storage.
Configuration reads and saves share RAM locks with cron application. Identical
configuration and prefix-history content is not rewritten.

Cancel and Resume remain explicit persistent decisions. Cancellation is published
atomically and synchronized before worker signals. Migrator checkpoints remain
on flash, separately from display state. Version 2 checkpoints contain source and
temporary paths, dataset GUIDs, and container restoration identities/policies.
They record rename intent before rename, and verified copy state before deleting
the temporary source. Missing or changed identities require manual recovery.
Legacy recovery checkpoints retain their companion files until recovery finishes.

The installation-only migration script quarantines old deletion and batch
records as review-required evidence in RAM. It never executes them. Historical
send cursors are quarantined, not accepted as proof of current ZFS completion.
Migrator status history, send history and failed logs are lost on reboot.

## Verification to date

- Existing stage-one and reliability suites pass in disposable containers.
- Migrator recovery simulation covers legacy checkpoints and version 2 recovery
  with all folder/container display files removed.
- `tests/reliability/ram_runtime.sh` passes with a read-only `/boot` fixture.
  `strace -f -e trace=%file` reports zero attempted writes or metadata changes to
  `/boot` for runtime layout, cursor publication, failure captures, configuration
  reads, polling, and migrator progress. This is scoped coverage, not yet proof
  for every end-to-end scheduling and worker path.
- Actual batch endpoints pass, including partial failure, failed-only retries,
  identity changes, approval expiry, limits and exact deletion boundaries.
- PHP/Bash parsing and ShellCheck error-level checks pass.
- Existing real-ZFS full/incremental/cancel/resume regression passes with unique
  disposable file-backed pools; a follow-up check found no remaining test pools.
- Temporary package inventory matches source; no release artifacts were updated.

## Cleanup dependency repair

Queued/waiting sends now protect exact selected snapshots, planned source and
receiver bases, target checkpoints, and resume-token bases. Active attempts retain
whole-tree exclusion until shutdown. Plans capture source dataset and base GUIDs
and revalidate them before transfer. Pool preparation waits for dependent preflight
plans before queueing cleanup. Unplanned work must choose and validate its base
when planned; it cannot pin every snapshot in a dataset while waiting.

Space approval uses measured availability. If planning finds no deletion work,
no pending freeing and no outstanding transfer reservations, the job fails with
required/available byte counts and an explicit free-space/Retry instruction.
Dependency waits leave attempt counts unchanged.

`tests/reliability/dependencies.sh` exercises shared destinations, independent
bases, resume references, unrelated deletion admission, active exclusion, and the
production space-admission function's terminal and waiting paths. Stage-one and
reliability suites pass after these changes. Both Chromium suites passed using
Node 22. The replication executor still uses the existing Bash queue handler; see the remaining scope below.

## Coordinator and scheduling delivered

The PHP CLI service owns Auto Snapshot runs, Snapshot Manager batch attempts and
shared deletion-daemon launch attempts. Its Unix socket remains responsive to
partial clients and concurrent configuration saves. A versioned, checksummed RAM
checkpoint publishes commands before acknowledgment. Stable command IDs preserve
idempotency during service restart. Each worker waits for a grant after its PID,
start time and process group have been recorded. Recovery stops and verifies old
process groups before admitting another attempt. Pipeline children must also stop.

The state model separates schedules, runs, tasks and attempts. It distinguishes
resource/dependency/array/configuration/space waits from transient failures; waits
do not consume retries. Transient failures receive two retries at 60 and 300
seconds, using monotonic deadlines. Terminal summaries expire after 30 days or
1,000 runs; compact command receipts remain for the boot. Referenced attempt and
configuration artifacts are preserved until their journal evidence is pruned.

Auto Snapshot now submits through the coordinator from Run Now and cron. Workers
receive captured configuration in RAM and check the live revision before each
mutation. New elapsed schedules start one interval after Save. Legacy cron
alignment remains until conversion is selected; previews show that alignment.
Run Now does not move the anchor. The shared calculator supports five-field cron,
daily/weekly calendar schedules, repeated DST times and nonexistent local times.
Cancellation records its persistent fence and pause before signaling; the API
separates that acknowledgment from verified shutdown. Resume is explicit.

Snapshot Manager submission receives a stable run ID. Each granted attempt executes
at most 50 items. Status requests only read atomic manifests and deletion results;
they never republish state or start a worker. Failed-only retries retain the
five-minute review requirement. Deletion execution has its own coordinator-owned
process group, independent of each batch chunk. Dataset Migrator now holds the
same RAM dataset/ancestor gates as the other workers during normal and recovery
operations.

Send schedules now have versioned specifications in the existing configuration.
Existing jobs retain their actual local epoch-window alignment, including the
legacy Thursday-based seven-day window, until explicitly converted. New elapsed
intervals anchor at Save; new daily/weekly schedules use a chosen local start time
and weekday. The Send page uses the shared preview endpoint. Calendar activation
prevents a new schedule from catching up an occurrence before it was saved.
Actual endpoint tests verify unchanged calendar saves retain their time and anchor,
and invalid times do not change configuration. The existing Bash scheduler reads
these specs through the same PHP occurrence calculator during admission.

The legacy send scheduler now records accepted occurrences separately from
success in RAM. Exhausted failures remain visible but do not block later
occurrences. Clearing a failed display record does not recreate that occurrence.

## Flash-write inventory

| Path | Purpose and permitted writers |
| --- | --- |
| `/boot/config/plugins/zfs.autosnapshot/zfs_autosnapshot.conf`, `zfs_send.conf` | Explicit atomic configuration saves, installation defaults |
| `/boot/config/plugins/zfs.autosnapshot/send-prefix-history` | Explicit configuration saves; unchanged content is skipped |
| `/boot/config/plugins/zfs.autosnapshot/send-control` | Explicit Cancel/Resume fences and pauses |
| `/boot/config/plugins/zfs.autosnapshot/dataset_migrator/recovery.env` | Safety-transition checkpoints only; source/target identities and container restoration obligations |
| Legacy flash runtime directories | Installation-only quarantine/migration; never automatic replay |
| `/tmp/zfs-autosnapshot-ops` | Job records, accepted/completed cursors, deletion results, reviewed batches |
| `/tmp/zfs-autosnapshot-coordinator` | Journal, command receipts, attempt grants and captured configuration |
| `/tmp/zfs-autosnapshot-migrator` | Migrator status, progress, folder/container display state |
| `/var/run/zfs-autosnapshot-*`, `/tmp/zfs-autosnapshot-config-locks` | Ownership, locks and socket |
| `/var/log/zfs_autosnapshot*`, `/var/log/zfs-autosnapshot-failed-sends` | Bounded routine logs and failure captures |

There is no pool-backed state directory or periodic RAM-to-flash checkpoint.

## Additional verification

- Full stage-one and reliability suites passed after coordinator integration.
- Actual batch endpoints verify a 601-item selection requires at least 13 granted
  attempts, duplicate submissions retain a run ID, and polling does not replace
  the manifest inode. Partial failure, failed-only retry and exact deletes pass.
- Actual daemon tests cover captured configuration, committed cancellation,
  verified shutdown, complete RAM loss, persistent pause, explicit Resume, and
  cancellation while a configuration-save lock is held.
- Socket/executor tests cover partial requests, duplicate/conflicting commands,
  SIGKILL recovery, surviving pipeline children, interrupted checkpoint
  publication, corrupt checkpoint rejection and retention of active evidence.
- Schedule tests cover seven-minute/five-hour intervals, Save anchors, catch-up,
  legacy alignment, retry exhaustion acceptance and calendar DST gaps/folds.
- `coordinator_flash.php` passed with `/boot` mounted read-only. A syscall trace
  found zero attempted boot-flash writes or metadata changes during daemon
  launch, completion, duplicate submission, polling and batch admission. This
  extends the earlier runtime trace; it does not certify every transfer path.
- Both Chromium suites, PHP parsing and ShellCheck error-level checks passed.
- Real disposable pools passed full/incremental sends, cancellation and explicit
  resume. An added quota-shortage fixture used the production reference exclusion
  predicate before cleanup, preserved the incremental base, reclaimed sufficient
  measured space, completed the transfer and preserved unrelated snapshots. This
  is not yet an end-to-end test of the new coordinator's replication phases.

## Remaining plan scope — not release complete

Replication creation, preparation, fan-out, retries and finalization still use
the Bash queue handler. The coordinator is therefore **not yet the sole authority
for all work**. Deletion's internal queue/result transitions still reside in its
existing worker. Batch cancellation is not exposed through the Auto Snapshot
Cancel API. Complete send integration must preserve existing GUID, hold, clone,
resume-target, destination and pipeline protections.

Re-planning replication and already-attempted automatic work after a configuration revision change,
ZFS-proven reboot completion suppression, complete dependency/recovery status
fields, and comprehensive idle-scan, timezone-change and all-path flash-write
instrumentation also remain. The shared calculator alone does not complete these
production behaviors.

After reboot, RAM history, batch approval and manual-send authority are gone.
Manual interrupted transfers require explicit Retry; batches require a fresh
review and previous per-item results may be unavailable. Persistent pauses and
migration safety checkpoints survive. Exactly-once execution across a reboot is
not promised.

## Follow-up: Auto Snapshot configuration admission (source only)

Untouched queued automatic runs now adopt an atomically read configuration pair
before launch. The RAM journal records the replacement revision and original
revision while preserving the run ID, command receipt and accepted occurrence.
Admission uses the shared nonblocking configuration lock, so an in-progress save
cannot supply mixed settings or stall cancellation. Configuration capture is
published by atomic rename and repairs partial captures left by an interrupted
older publication.

Manual requests never acquire new approval implicitly. Runs with any previous
attempt, legacy records without the captured schedule specification, disabled or
converted schedules, and empty dataset selections fail configuration admission
without starting a worker or consuming a transient retry. In particular, a new
Save anchor does not cause an old queued occurrence to run immediately. Workers
already running retain their captured settings and existing revision checks
before each mutation. Safe replanning after partial execution still requires
per-item completion evidence and remains outstanding.

`coordinator_replan.php` covers stable identity/acceptance, restart, capture repair,
manual approval, recovered attempts, rejected siblings and schedule changes.
`coordinator_replan_daemon.php` exercises the production daemon with a harmless
worker: execution once with new settings, rejection of stale manual authority,
and responsive status during a configuration lock. Run the latter in its own
disposable container because it writes production-style fixture paths.
The full stage-one and reliability suites, existing Auto Snapshot daemon test,
read-only-boot coordinator fixture, PHP lint, changed-shell checks and temporary
package inventory verification pass. These changes are not in the published
`2026.09.16.01` package; release artifacts are unchanged.

## Follow-up: fixed replication manifests and deletion ownership (source only)

Replication preparation now commits a versioned membership manifest to RAM before
publishing its first child. It captures source datasets, destinations, selected
snapshot names, snapshot GUIDs and source dataset GUIDs. Recovery reuses that
membership instead of enumerating a changed recursive tree or filtering a new
set of missing resume members. Existing successful children are retained only
when their immutable transfer identity matches. Finalizers carry expected child
identity digests and require explicit matching success for every child. The
source dataset GUID is also checked before transfer. Selected members whose
child files have not yet been published remain protected from cleanup.

Legacy pending finalizers without identity evidence fail validation; they do not
mark an occurrence complete merely because positional child IDs exist. Existing
successful history is not rewritten. This does not yet solve the earlier crash
window between ZFS snapshot creation and publication of the preparation record,
and it does not implement automatic replanning after partially completed work.
The Bash queue handler still owns replication admission and retries.

Replication cleanup now uses the coordinator deletion submission path. The Bash
helper no longer falls back to an untracked worker when the coordinator is
unavailable; queued requests remain in RAM. After verified deletion-worker
shutdown, the coordinator checks the inbox, interrupted processing files and
queued state before completing the pump. Late submissions coalesced into an
exiting run therefore receive another granted attempt without consuming a
transient retry. Deletion's individual queue transitions remain worker-owned.
The coordinator also skips unchanged batch-manifest publication after worker
completion, fixing an inode-change race observed by the read-only polling test.

Verification: the full reliability and stage-one suites pass. `send_manifest.sh`
interrupts fan-out after one child, changes the discovered dataset tree, preserves
successful evidence, rejects changed GUIDs and verifies explicit zero-child
resume finalization. It passes with `/boot` mounted read-only. Run
`coordinator_delete.php` in a separate disposable container; its production daemon
fixture verifies late enqueue, one run with two verified attempts, and stranded
inbox/queued-state recovery. Actual 601-item batch endpoint tests, the existing
read-only-boot coordinator fixture, ShellCheck, PHP/Bash checks and temporary
package verification pass. Disposable real-ZFS full/incremental, cancel/resume,
low-space cleanup, base and unrelated-snapshot preservation tests pass; no test
pools remained. The real-ZFS suite does not yet exercise full coordinator-owned
replication phases. No release artifacts or installation were changed.

## Development package 2026.09.16.02

This package includes the source-only follow-ups recorded above: automatic
configuration admission, fixed replication manifests, coordinator-owned cleanup
launches and late deletion submission recovery. Both manifests retain the fork
branch pluginURL so existing branch clients can discover the higher version.
Full replication coordination and replanning after partial execution remain
unfinished. Release artifacts are committed separately from source and docs.

## Coordinator completion branch: recovery boundaries (2026-09-17)

Work continues on `fix/coordinator-completion`, based on `feat/ui-overhaul`.
This is source work for the planned complete release; it does not change the
published version, install manifests, packages, or update channels.

The RAM journal now uses protocol version 2 and accepts version 1 checkpoints
from the same boot. Each granted attempt carries the coordinator generation,
task ID and attempt token. Workers can propose bounded progress, explicit results
and an atomic child graph over the Unix socket. Ordered report sequences reject
conflicting or stale publications, while replaying the last accepted report is
idempotent. Preparation graphs require a finalizer that depends on every child.
Reported completion never releases resources before verified group shutdown.
These capabilities are tested, but replication adapters are not yet migrated to
this protocol.

Scheduled replication now publishes exact snapshot creation targets and source
dataset GUIDs in RAM before invoking ZFS. Explicit targets freeze recursive
membership. Snapshot GUIDs are committed before child publication. If execution
is interrupted without those GUIDs, existing targets are preserved and require
review. The intent retains cleanup protection even if the create command exits
with an error and retries are exhausted. Successful GUID publication clears the
recovery flag. Explicitly clearing an ambiguous recovery record warns that its
cleanup protection will be released. Intent publication failure prevents creation.

Snapshot Manager publishes an item intent before execution and its result
immediately after execution, rather than deferring all results until chunk end.
An interrupted non-delete item becomes a failed item requiring a fresh review;
rollback is never automatically repeated. Deletion continues to reconcile its
stable ID and existing result record. Failed-only retry still creates a new
review, and previously completed items are retained. Recovery flags appear in
batch and coordinator status. These records remain RAM-only and disappear on
reboot; no old approval is reconstructed.

Status reads and rejected socket requests no longer force an admission tick.
Accepted mutation commands and the watchdog still wake the coordinator, with
the existing maximum 30-second recovery deadline.

Verification for this increment:

- Stage-one and full reliability suites passed in disposable containers.
- Actual 601-item batch endpoints passed, including bounded chunks, partial
  failures, failed-only retries, approval expiry and exact deletion boundaries.
- A SIGKILL fixture interrupts a batch after the mutation and before result
  publication, verifies review is required, and verifies no repeated mutation.
- Real granted fixture workers exercised progress, duplicate reports, child graph
  publication, explicit child failure, finalizer dependencies and stale rejection
  through the production Unix-socket client and executor.
- Actual Auto Snapshot daemon checks passed for captured settings, cancellation,
  verified shutdown, RAM loss and persistent pause/Resume.
- New intent/recovery fixtures and the coordinator flash fixture passed with
  `/boot` read-only. A file-syscall trace recorded 199 `/boot` accesses and zero
  attempted writes or metadata changes. This remains scoped fixture coverage,
  not certification of all transfer paths.

- Disposable real-ZFS pools passed the new exact-target creation/GUID fixture,
  fixed membership after a child dataset is added, and the existing full/incremental,
  cancel/resume, shortage cleanup and unrelated-snapshot preservation checks.
  A follow-up `zpool list` found no remaining test pools.
- Chromium workspace checks passed across all sections, desktop/tablet/mobile,
  recovery presentation, and dismissal/acceptance of the clear-protection warning.
- A package built only under `/tmp` matched the source inventory. No release
  artifact was added to the repository.

The remaining-plan section above still applies. In particular, individual
replication/deletion transitions, batch cancellation across deletion children,
partial-execution replanning, conservative reboot completion proof, full-path
flash tracing and coordinator-driven real-ZFS acceptance remain unfinished.
User-run Unraid checks remain the final release gate. Publish one completed main
release afterward, with update manifests for existing fork preview clients.

## Ownership update: journal and admission foundation

The approved ownership update is being implemented on `fix/coordinator-completion`.
The first increment introduces journal version 3: checksummed, sequenced RAM
append records with atomic checkpoints after 1,024 records or 8 MiB. The checkpoint
publishes before covered log records are removed. Recovery discards only an
incomplete trailing append, rejects complete corrupt records and sequence gaps,
and preserves accepted commands across interrupted compaction. Diagnostic readers
replay the log and retry if checkpoint/log replacement races their read.

Version 1/2 coordinator checkpoints remain readable. Pending manual runs are
marked as requiring fresh approval during this ownership upgrade. Completed
results remain intact, and active attempts retain ownership until shutdown is
verified. This does not invalidate approvals on ordinary version 3 restarts.
The complete legacy send/batch installation handoff remains to be implemented.

Admission now maintains ready tasks, reverse dependencies, active tasks and a
monotonic deadline heap in memory. The executor checks active attempts rather
than repeatedly traversing historical attempts and tasks. Indexes rebuild from
the journal after restart and invalidate canceled work and obsolete deadlines.
Journal delta detection still traverses entity records at publication; moving
large per-item execution onto this journal will also require measuring that cost.

Preparation plans can be staged in chunks of at most 50 task specifications.
Each chunk is ordered, checksummed through the journal and replay-safe. A final
seal checks the complete count, digest, dependency graph and required finalizer
before publishing executable child tasks. Sealing supports up to 50,001 tasks
(50,000 items plus finalizer). The parent cannot report success before sealing,
and children still wait for verified parent shutdown. The existing single-message
protocol remains supported for small plans.

Verification: full reliability suite; actual 601-item batch endpoints; actual
Auto Snapshot and deletion-daemon fixtures; PHP parsing; new torn-append,
compaction, sequence-gap, manual-upgrade and index-rebuild fixtures. A 10,000-task
fixture verifies dependency/deadline/cancellation indexing. A 1,101-child staged
plan verifies chunk replay, partial-plan exclusion and sealing after restart.
The new storage/index/plan fixtures and coordinator runtime fixture also pass
with read-only `/boot`. These checks do not certify all-path flash-write behavior.

Remaining implementation: per-item authorization/results in the coordinator,
unified deletion and Auto Snapshot mutation admission, full replication phases
and scheduling, Snapshot Manager execution ownership and shared cancellation,
installation handoff, compatibility/status migration and full acceptance gates.
No release artifact, update URL or published version changes in this increment.

## Ownership update: approved batch item authority

Non-delete Snapshot Manager execution now uses coordinator-owned item records.
Submission captures immutable approved item specifications. The worker requests
at most 50 items from the journal, receives an acknowledged start grant for one
item at a time, and reports a bounded result before starting the next item. Grant
membership and fingerprints prevent expanding or changing the reviewed selection.
Repeated report acknowledgments return the same response without new authority.
The old batch worker refuses non-delete execution; older batch tasks without item
authority require a new review rather than falling back to worker-owned state.

The coordinator projects execution results into the existing RAM batch manifest
for endpoint compatibility. The execution worker does not publish that manifest.
Projection runs after item reports and verified process transitions. Existing
selection capture and review remain in the endpoint. Deletion batches still use
the legacy deletion adapter and are not yet covered by this ownership handoff.

On verified shutdown, an item started without a committed result becomes failed
and recovery-required. Completed items remain completed and untouched items can
continue in another grant. An item report does not release process ownership.
Ambiguous item evidence and its batch projection are exempt from ordinary terminal
retention while review remains unresolved. No extra flash writes are introduced.

Verification: full reliability suite and the actual 601-item endpoint suite pass.
New item-state fixtures cover chunk limits, immutable membership, start response
replay, serial execution, committed results, stale/canceled reports, recovery and
retention. `coordinator_batch_recovery.php`, run in its own disposable container,
uses the actual daemon and new worker, kills the coordinator while a simulated
ZFS mutation is active, verifies surviving-process shutdown, preserves the
ambiguous item for review, and completes the untouched item exactly once. PHP
parsing and the item/coordinator runtime fixtures with read-only `/boot` pass.

Still required: unified deletion execution, Auto Snapshot mutation authority,
full replication phases and scheduling, shared cancellation, complete legacy
installation handoff, configuration replanning and the remaining release gates.

## Ownership update: single-deletion adapter foundation

A granted single-deletion adapter now reuses the existing worker's safety checks
without loading or flushing its internal queue. It verifies coordinator ownership
through the worker socket before processing, takes the global deletion lock,
returns array/resource waits immediately, and reports an explicit result. Local
and remote destroy execution make one attempt; transient retries belong to the
coordinator. It never publishes authoritative deletion result files.

`coordinator_delete_adapter.php` uses the real socket, executor and adapter with
mock ZFS. It verifies exact deletion, changed-GUID and held-snapshot exclusion,
explicit outcomes, one failed destroy per grant and coordinator retry scheduling.
Run it in a disposable container with the plugin and sbin source mounted at their
production paths. ShellCheck error-level and readiness safety checks pass.

This adapter is not yet selected by the production daemon. Deletion submission
import, individual task/result projections and shared run ownership must be wired
before replacing the existing deletion pump. The legacy worker remains executable
and can now also be sourced by the adapter without starting its daemon loop.

## Ownership update: individual deletion admission

The production coordinator now imports versioned RAM deletion submissions into
stable per-snapshot tasks and selects the single-attempt adapter. A committed
command receipt precedes advancement of the import cursor, so interrupted drains
can replay without repeating an accepted deletion. Admission is limited to 50
records per pass. Idle import checks occur at most every 30 seconds, with immediate
wakeups for submissions. Workers no longer own deletion retries or result files;
results are projected only after verified process-group shutdown. The legacy
worker executable now submits a coordinator wakeup instead of starting its queue
loop. Its safety functions remain available to the adapter.

New submissions capture snapshot GUIDs, configuration hashes and, for Snapshot
Manager, the authorizing batch run. Legacy records and conflicting identities are
retained as RAM review evidence, never replayed as execution authority. Existing
legacy queue displays are copied to review evidence before replacement. Old batch
tasks lacking the new deletion protocol require fresh review. This does not yet
constitute the full installation handoff: old processing spools and surviving
legacy processes still require the planned upgrade procedure.

Attempt input files are removed only after their journal tasks are pruned.
Deletion results retain active task and unfinished batch references; unreferenced
results are bounded to 30 days or 1,000 files. Completed child records remain while
their owning run is active or requires recovery review. All these records remain
in RAM and disappear after reboot.

Verification includes the reliability suite, deletion import replay/conflict and
legacy-evidence fixtures, the real socket/adapter fixture, retention tests and
admission with read-only `/boot`. The endpoint deletion-failure fixture allows the
full initial/60/300-second attempt sequence before testing a failed-only retry;
that endpoint suite passes, including the 601-item fixture and daemon restart.
Stage-one, PHP/Bash, ShellCheck and temporary package verification also pass.

Still unfinished: coordinator-owned deletion-batch item execution, shared cleanup
owners and cancellation, Auto Snapshot mutations, full replication phase planning,
configuration replanning, legacy installation handoff and the remaining release
acceptance gates. No release artifact or update URL changes accompany this source
increment.

## Ownership update: deletion-batch grant and recovery barriers

The remaining compatibility deletion-batch worker now validates its current
attempt, generation and sequence over the coordinator socket before acquiring
worker ownership, inspecting inventories or enqueueing an item. An environment
flag alone is insufficient. It checks again for every item in its bounded chunk;
expired or canceled ownership stops further submissions.

Recovery now blocks all new attempt grants until surviving process groups have
been verified stopped, including work of another task kind. A recovering batch
can hold resources that its concurrency category does not describe. The socket
remains responsive during this barrier; ordinary cancellation does not impose a
global recovery barrier.

Upgrade projection reconciles committed deletion results first, then marks
unresolved `queued`, `running` and `deleting` items failed and recovery-required.
Completed, skipped and failed results remain intact. This closes the case where
an unresolved legacy `deleting` item could remain stranded without fresh review.

`coordinator_batch_handoff.php` covers ungranted launches, an expired generation
rejected by the real socket, acceptance of a current grant, unresolved deletion
review and preservation of committed results. It also passes with read-only
`/boot`. The crash fixture now queues an unrelated deletion during restart and
asserts that no new command is admitted before old attempts have stopped. The
full reliability suite and PHP checks pass. The actual batch endpoint suite
also passes, including deletion retry exhaustion, fresh failed-only retry, daemon
restart and the 601-item fixture. Temporary package verification passes.

This is a recovery prerequisite, not the completed deletion-batch ownership
migration: the compatibility worker still owns deletion-batch item transitions
and must be replaced by journal-owned item/dependency transitions. Shared cleanup
ownership, full replication integration and the previously listed release gates
remain open.

## Ownership update: journal-owned deletion batches

New Snapshot Manager deletion batches now use immutable journal items. The
coordinator delegates at most 50 items to individual deletion runs, exposes their
dependencies and waits without a batch process, transfer slot or retry timer.
Verified child outcomes update journal items and wake the next chunk. Partial
failures preserve successful results and do not cancel untouched selections.
Finalization waits for every selected item's terminal outcome.

Stable child command IDs make interrupted delegation replayable. Recovery counts
already-delegated items against the 50-item window. Legacy inbox submissions cannot
add items to a journal-owned approval. The compatibility batch worker is no longer
selected by the production daemon; pending approvals without journal items require
fresh review. Operation-boundary metadata, exclusion and cleanup-policy checks now
run in the deletion adapter's existing review check, preserving safety after the
old batch preparation worker is removed from this path.

Batch manifests are compatibility projections. Contended projections retry, and
restart rebuilds them from committed items. The fixture covers bounded admission,
immutable membership, interrupted delegation, partial failure, inbox rejection,
projection locking and reconstruction. It passes with read-only `/boot`. The full
reliability suite, stage-one checks, PHP parsing, actual batch endpoint suite and
temporary package verification pass. Endpoint coverage includes retry exhaustion,
fresh failed-only retry, daemon restart and 601-item selections.

Still open: cancellation propagation and shared cleanup ownership, full replication
and Auto Snapshot mutation authority, complete installation handoff, configuration
replanning and remaining release gates. Large-journal commit and inventory costs
still require the planned scale work; no all-path performance claim is made here.

## Ownership update: batch cancellation and Activity controls

Cancel now persists the batch decision before revoking its exclusively owned
child runs. Queued children are canceled immediately; running children retain
ownership until process-group shutdown is verified. The parent remains canceling
until its children stop. Untouched batch items receive terminal retry-review
reasons, while committed results remain available. Unrelated runs continue.
Repeated cancellation retains the same persistent decision without rewriting it.
Manual batch cancellation does not pause Auto Snapshot.

Activity exposes Cancel for coordinator batch runs, routes it to the coordinator
endpoint and uses batch-specific confirmation text. Status distinguishes committed
cancellation from verified shutdown. A failed persistent control write returns an
explicit error without changing the runtime cancellation decision.

The actual endpoint fixture covers 51 selected items, delegated and untouched
membership, failed persistent publication, successful retry, no unrelated schedule
pause, final result projection and restart. The process fixture checks a live
child, a queued child and unrelated work. Full reliability, stage-one, PHP checks,
workspace browser tests and temporary package verification pass.

This ownership relation is exclusive. Shared prerequisite cleanup with multiple
independently valid authorizations still needs its planned detach/retain semantics;
this increment does not treat shared work as exclusively owned.

## Ownership update: deletion approval and result authority

Deletion attempts now receive a RAM approval artifact captured from the journal's
immutable batch parameters and selected item. It is bound to the task, job, batch,
snapshot and GUID. The operation-boundary checker validates this capture and the
current configuration revision instead of using the mutable status manifest as
approval. Missing, mismatched or symlinked captures fail closed. Pending legacy
manual deletion records without journal-owned item approval require fresh review.
Approval artifacts are pruned only after their journal tasks are removed.

The granted adapter no longer accepts compatibility deletion-result files as proof
of successful execution. Journal-owned batch projections and status reconciliation
also preserve journal item states rather than replacing them with compatibility
file contents. Legacy manifest recovery still reconciles its old committed result
evidence before requiring fresh approval for unfinished items.

The approval fixture covers missing captures, exact selection, task/job/version
binding, configuration changes, symlinks and independence from status manifests;
it passes with read-only `/boot`. Adapter coverage injects a stale result file and
verifies explicit execution/outcome reporting. Journal-item tests verify that
neither projection nor endpoint reconciliation fabricates completion from such a
file. Retention tests cover captured approvals alongside active task inputs.

Shared cleanup cancellation still needs the replication ownership handoff: legacy
send producers currently provide schedule/configuration identity, not coordinator
run authorization. Multiple independently valid owners must be registered before
any cancel/detach behavior can safely retain another run's cleanup authority.

The obsolete `snapshot-batch-worker.php` entry point is now retired: it returns a
review-required error without loading manifests, acquiring worker locks or issuing
ZFS commands. Existing launcher paths remain recognizable to installation/shutdown
cleanup, but no environment flag or old grant can restore manifest-owned execution.
The handoff fixture verifies this rejection and preservation of existing evidence.

Verification for this authority increment: full reliability and stage-one suites,
actual batch endpoints (including real retry deadlines and failed-only retry),
batch crash recovery, batch cancellation, PHP parsing, ShellCheck and temporary
package verification pass. The scoped approval-path syscall trace recorded zero
attempted `/boot` mutations. Full replication and all-path flash certification
remain separate unfinished gates.

## Ownership update: replication reference registration boundary

Coordinator submissions and preparation plans now validate and register exact
source, base, checkpoint and resume references with endpoint, dataset identity,
snapshot name and GUID. Plan children and reference records publish together;
unsealed chunks cannot create either execution authority or reference ownership.
A plan that asks cleanup to delete its own required reference is rejected before
publication. A planner also cannot claim an identity already owned by an active
deletion attempt; it must prepare again after verified shutdown.

The production deletion admission adapter checks registered references before
launch. Protected cleanup waits on a bounded 30-second dependency deadline with
no process, transfer slot or retry attempt. Name/GUID indexes avoid repeatedly
scanning inventories or historical reference records. Protection lasts through
run finalization, and recovery-required terminal runs retain evidence. Canceling
one reference owner does not release another owner's protection. Pruning removes
reference records only with their owning tasks.

Endpoint identities are captured, but deletion submissions do not yet carry a
verified endpoint identity. Matching therefore conservatively protects the same
snapshot name or GUID across endpoints. This can delay unrelated remote work;
relaxing it requires the planned destination identity handoff, not a hostname
assumption.

Verification covers malformed references, atomic rejection, active-delete races,
self-destructive dependency plans, two reference owners, finalization/recovery
retention, restart and 10,000 indexed references. Staged-plan tests verify atomic
reference publication at seal. Reference and deletion admission fixtures pass
with read-only `/boot`; reliability, stage-one, real deletion-adapter and actual
batch-cancellation endpoint checks pass.

This is a prerequisite for the replication handoff, not completed integration.
Legacy send planning still publishes its existing reference files and does not
yet submit this schema. Shared cleanup execution authorizations, cancellation
attachment/detachment, replication worker phases and the earlier release gates
remain unfinished.

## Direction change: standalone native coordinator

The user has deprioritized legacy integration and intends a renamed standalone
plugin. Automatic migration of the original runtime queues and a legacy preview
update bridge are no longer release requirements. Preserve ZFS safety protections,
but implement native coordinator phases directly. See
[standalone development](standalone-development.md) for the revised delivery order.
No installation identity or published URL has changed yet.

## Native replication: bounded local destination inspection

The coordinator can now grant a `prepare` task with phase `replication_inspect`.
It captures the immutable request in RAM and starts a read-only PHP worker. The
worker validates its live grant before reading input or inspecting ZFS. It checks
source/destination dataset identities, exact selected snapshot GUID, name-and-GUID
common bases, receive-token presence and identity changes during inspection.
Transaction-group ordering uses decimal strings, avoiding signed 64-bit truncation.

Every ZFS query has a 15-second timeout with a two-second kill grace and bounded
stdout/stderr. The timeout remains in the granted worker's process group. Slow
inspection does not block socket status/cancellation. A receive token requires
explicit validated recovery; inspection never resumes it or publishes the token.
Transient command failures return to coordinator retries; validation failures are
explicit. Captured inputs follow journal retention and stay in RAM.

This phase currently supports local, existing destinations and explicit snapshots.
It reports inspected reference candidates, not committed transfer permission.
The planner, space approval, transfer, recursive mapping, SSH and receiver-creation
phases still need implementation. There is no public end-to-end native replication
submission path yet, so existing clients are not directed into an incomplete run.

Verification: inspection unit fixtures cover 10,000 snapshots, exact GUID matching,
64-bit transaction groups, malformed inventory, overlapping trees, changed receiver
identity and token-required recovery. A real socket/granted-worker fixture verifies
responsiveness, same-group cancellation, actual timeout and coordinator retry with
read-only `/boot`. The disposable real-ZFS suite verifies native base inspection
alongside existing transfer, low-space, cancellation and resume protections. Full
reliability, stage-one, PHP/ShellCheck and temporary package verification pass.
These tests do not certify an end-to-end native coordinator replication pipeline.

## Standalone source identity: ZFS SnapSync

Applied plugin ID `zfs.snapsync` across configuration, RAM directories, logs,
commands, lifecycle hooks, cron, WebGUI routes, package names and update manifests.
Default snapshot namespaces are `snapsync-auto-` and `snapsync-send-`; the manual
hold tag is `snapsync-manual`. No original-plugin configuration or execution
approval is imported. Release verification rejects original installation/runtime
identities and requires the matching SnapSync update manifest.

Verification: complete reliability and stage-one suites; actual batch cancellation
endpoint; granted inspection worker responsiveness, cancellation and timeout retry;
workspace browser suite; all PHP lint and shell-script ShellCheck error checks;
temporary package build and source-content verification. Disposable ZFS pools
passed full/incremental transfer, GUID mismatch rejection, cancellation and pipeline
shutdown, explicit resume, prerequisite low-space cleanup and unrelated snapshot
preservation. These exercise existing transfer adapters, not a completed native
coordinator replication pipeline.

Generated release artifacts remain unchanged and unpublished for SnapSync. The
README documents the intended standalone URL and explicitly identifies it as not
yet published. Independent paths and default prefixes do not make simultaneous
operations on the same datasets safe across two independent plugins. Native
replication planning/transfer/finalization, shared cleanup ownership, remaining
mutation authority and full release acceptance remain open.

## Native receiver lineage and completion boundary

Read-only replication preparation now reports an incremental candidate,
GUID-proven `already_received`, or `full_requires_receiver_approval`. It rejects
same-name/different-GUID targets, nonempty snapshot histories without a common
base, and receiver snapshots at or after the proposed incremental checkpoint.
Receiver ordering uses receiver TXGs only, including unsigned 64-bit values.
An empty snapshot inventory is explicitly not permission to overwrite an existing
filesystem. Already-received evidence includes the exact destination checkpoint
reference; its GUID and the receiver inventory are rechecked before returning.

Verification: full reliability suite, real granted inspection worker cancellation
and timeout retries, PHP lint, and disposable ZFS integration. New pool assertions
prove completion even with a later unrelated receiver snapshot, reject a subsequent
transfer requiring rollback, and verify that the unrelated snapshot survives.
Fixtures also cover completion identity races and inventory changes during
inspection. This phase is still read-only: native reference publication, cleanup,
space approval, transfer admission and finalization remain to be connected.

## Native local manual replication execution

Snapshot Manager Send now submits a stable command to the coordinator. Submission
pins the selected source snapshot; preparation atomically publishes exact references
and space, transfer and verification tasks. The native pipeline supports a single
local full send to a new receiver under an existing, GUID-captured parent, or an
incremental send to a verified receiver. Existing datasets are never overwritten.
Full/incremental execution reports explicit outcomes; finalization checks receiver
GUID evidence from its expected transfer child. Already-received snapshots produce
verification-only tasks. Configured rate limits are captured and native concurrency
limits follow settings. Dataset/Migrator gates remain held during execution.

Activity includes native replication and routes cancellation to its coordinator.
Cancel persists before worker signals; manual cancellation does not pause Auto
Snapshot. UI retries of an accepted submission return the original receipt even
when a full transfer has since created the receiver. No manual work is reconstructed
from ZFS metadata after RAM loss. Snapshot Manager Send no longer writes a legacy
send job or starts the old queue worker.

Verification: reliability and stage-one suites, PHP lint, adapter ShellCheck,
workspace browser suite, native graph/reference/cancellation unit coverage, and
actual daemon plus disposable-pool full/incremental sends, explicit child outcomes,
measured space, duplicate submission/no-op and persistent array-wait cancellation.
Scheduled replication, SSH, recursive planning, native prerequisite cleanup and
explicit native resume remain unfinished; automatic snapshot per-mutation ownership
and the wider release gates also remain open. No release artifacts published.

## Explicit native Retry and recovery evidence

Activity now offers Retry for stopped native manual runs. Retry creates one
idempotent successor, validates the token's exact target name/GUID and incremental
base identities, and preserves only a token hash in RAM records. Raw tokens are
read again and hash-checked immediately before execution. Changed configuration
requires a new Send review. Cancellation of an active transfer retains its recovery
references; a fully verified successor explicitly resolves the earlier evidence.
No Retry authority is reconstructed after RAM loss.

Compact command receipts now retain bounded selection/settings context so pruning
terminal task details cannot repeat a successful submission. Native preparation is
also forbidden from reporting success before publishing its expected child plan.
Validation includes unsigned 64-bit token GUIDs, wrong-target rejection, duplicate
Retry, pruned receipts, the reliability suite and browser Retry routing. A real
interrupted receive was resumed through the actual coordinator, finalized with GUID
checks and compared byte-for-byte to the source. Scheduled/recursive/SSH native
replication, prerequisite cleanup integration and the remaining release gates are
still outstanding.

## Native recursive scheduled-run graph

Added a native local scheduled-run RPC and bounded membership capture (up to 10,000
datasets). Membership is checked twice, freezes source dataset GUIDs and maps exact
destination paths. Snapshot tasks create one explicit snapshot each with atomic
schedule, occurrence and source-identity properties. Repeated execution adopts only
matching intent metadata; foreign same-name snapshots and replaced datasets fail.
Successful creation reports atomically register exact source references before
acknowledgment. Member plans wait for their source snapshot and parent receiver's
completed transfer. Dynamic preparation consumers now inherit the published
finalizer dependency, closing the planner-exit versus child-completion gap.

Plans publish in chunks of at most 50 tasks and become runnable only after sealing.
Each member uses the existing native space/transfer/verification graph; the run
finalizer requires explicit success from all captured members. Native scheduled
snapshot tasks cannot succeed from exit status alone. Cancellation persists the
schedule pause separately from Auto Snapshot. RAM captures are retained with their
tasks and pruned after evidence expires. Activity identifies these as replication.

Verification: reliability suite, nested graph restart/idempotency tests, 10,000
member planning, interrupted snapshot creation and foreign-intent fixtures, staged
plan and exact reference publication tests, browser checks, PHP lint, adapter
ShellCheck, and temporary package verification. Actual daemon/disposable-pool tests
completed a three-level recursive full send and a metadata-proven repeated run;
existing full/incremental, explicit resume and low-space cleanup tests also passed.

Automatic cron/timer admission and the existing Run Now UI have NOT been switched
to this graph yet. Native cleanup/retention and threshold policy must be integrated
before replacing the old scheduled path. Native SSH, shared cleanup authorization,
automatic replanning after mutations, full Auto Snapshot task ownership and remaining
flash/reboot/scale acceptance gates are still unfinished. No artifacts published.

## Native prerequisite retention and measured space

Scheduled member preparation now captures the schedule's retention policy and
publishes eligible receiver checkpoint deletions ahead of space approval. The
atomic plan registers exact replication references before any deletion can run.
Cleanup is limited to that schedule's prefix, retains newest/daily/weekly anchors,
and excludes holds, clones, incomplete metadata and protected names/GUIDs. Existing
delete-worker configuration and latest-common-checkpoint checks remain in force;
receiver dataset GUID is now also checked under the dataset gate. Waiting transfer
tasks hold no process, dataset lock or transfer slot during prerequisite deletion.

Space approval measures availability after cleanup and includes the captured
free-space target plus transfer allowance. A shortage waits without consuming a
retry only while ZFS reports freeing work; otherwise it fails with measured bytes
and a review/free-space action. Estimates never authorize transfer by themselves.

Verification: reliability and stage-one suites, PHP lint, ShellCheck, bounded worker
cancellation/timeout tests, retention and space policy fixtures. Actual coordinator
recursive execution on disposable pools began with a quota shortage, deleted the
eligible old checkpoint, preserved its incremental base, measured sufficient space
and completed every child. The same native scheduled path passed with the flash
fixture mounted read-only. This is a read-only-mount check, not a complete syscall
trace of every runtime path. Shared cleanup authorization, proactive low-space
policy beyond retention, native timer admission and SSH remain unfinished.

## Persistent cancellation ordering and targeted Resume

Coordinator cancellation now publishes the schedule pause before the run's
cancellation decision. A failed second write can leave the schedule safely paused,
but cannot leave an acknowledged cancellation with its schedule enabled. Signals
still follow both durable decisions. Resume accepts an explicit schedule ID and
preserves per-run cancellation evidence. The actual daemon fixture injects failure
into each publication, retries cancellation, verifies shutdown, and checks that
resuming a Send schedule does not alter Auto Snapshot. Batch cancellation and the
full reliability suite pass as regressions.

A proposed extension to delete retention anchors under low-space pressure was
rejected by automatic approval review pending explicit user approval. That command
made no changes. Native cleanup remains limited to retention-eligible snapshots;
insufficient space after permitted cleanup fails without deleting retained anchors.

## Opt-in retention anchor cleanup implementation

Local replication now captures a versioned per-job cleanup policy. The default is
retention-only. The `older_anchors` choice permits daily/weekly anchors outside the
keep-all window, only within the job's exact receiver dataset and prefix. Newest
checkpoints, exact replication references, holds and clones remain exclusions.
Ordinary retention runs first. A bounded RAM manifest is sealed before pressure
cleanup; the coordinator admits one deletion, waits for verified shutdown, then
remeasures space. Dataset identity, policy revision, required references, keep-all
cutoff and available space are checked again under the deletion gate. A fresh
worker grant precedes mutation. Reference-quota limits and impossible quota targets
fail without sacrificing anchors; freeing waits have a five-minute no-progress
limit. No runtime manifest or progress is written to flash.

Local timer admission and Run Now now use native coordinator runs. Run Now uses
stable command IDs, shares per-job overlap exclusion and does not shift cadence.
Old local queue admission is disabled; unstarted local records are retired and
interrupted manual work requires review. Existing active workers retain their
dataset gates. Network jobs retain their previous execution path. Old local
scheduled deletion inbox entries are quarantined rather than replayed.

Verification so far: reliability and stage-one suites; policy and real save
endpoints; native timing and legacy cutover fixtures; browser workspace suite;
PHP syntax and ShellCheck; temporary package build. The disposable real-ZFS suite
also passed with retained-anchor pressure cleanup and a read-only flash fixture.
The policy fixture covers 10,000 snapshots. A host-provided strace and its libraries were mounted read-only into the disposable
ZFS container. The native scheduled/anchor fixture recorded 6,133 boot-path calls
and zero file-write opens or path metadata mutation attempts; the fixture also
ran with boot flash read-only. This traces that fixture, not every plugin path.
The actual Run Now endpoint and browser policy default/edit/cancel/preservation
checks pass. The additional pressure fault coverage is recorded below. No release
artifacts were added to the repository or published.


## Pressure cleanup fault coverage

Added two fixtures to the reliability suite without changing production behavior:

- `pressure_faults.php` exercises torn RAM journal appends, discarding unsealed
  manifests before re-preparation, preserving sealed manifests on restart,
  out-of-order chunks, conflicting replay, invalid seals, stale worker attempts,
  configuration invalidation, and cancellation between deletions. It traverses
  51 candidates across two chunks using actual coordinator transitions, restarts
  after a completed child, mixes completed/skipped results, and verifies no replay
  or transfer admission after exhaustion. Sufficient space stops further deletion;
  monotonic freeing deadlines reset on progress and fail after five stalled minutes
  without consuming execution retries while waiting.
- `pressure_preflight.php` invokes the actual PHP pre-deletion executable with
  deterministic read-only ZFS command fixtures. It covers external space recovery,
  receiver/selected/newest/base identity replacement, keep-all cutoff equality,
  shared-GUID references, changed configuration revisions, invalid measurements,
  impossible destination/ancestor quotas, and pending or unknown freeing work.
  Every mocked ZFS invocation is asserted to be a read-only property query.

Both fixtures pass; the full reliability suite passes with them included. This
adds fault-path coverage to the earlier real-ZFS and read-only-flash evidence;
these deterministic preflight cases themselves do not destroy real snapshots.
The broader standalone release gates remain tracked separately. Nothing deployed
or published by this coverage change.
